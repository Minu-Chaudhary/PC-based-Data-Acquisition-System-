# PC-based-Data-Acquisition-System
  The main objective of this project is that here data acquisition refers to reading the data continuously from any sensor and so we are continuously monitoring the data through PC using UART. The data which we are receiving from the sensor is received by the micro controller using ADC. We need to monitor this data on the PC and on the LCD, and so here we get the information like Time and Voltage readings with our data by using Embedded C language.
